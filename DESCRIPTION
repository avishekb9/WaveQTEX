Description: Comprehensive framework for analyzing financial contagion using 
    Wavelet-based Quantile Transfer Entropy (WaveQTE) with machine learning 
    enhancements, efficient market hypothesis testing, and macroprudential 
    applications. This package extends the foundational WaveQTE methodology 
    with deep learning integration, multi-scale market efficiency testing, 
    and real-time macroprudential monitoring capabilities. Includes tools for 
    convolutional neural networks, LSTM models, transformer architectures, 
    ensemble learning, scale-dependent efficiency analysis, systemic risk 
    assessment, and early warning systems for financial crisis prediction.
